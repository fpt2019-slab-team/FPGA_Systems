PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/led_out_reg_reg[3]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/led_out_reg_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/led_out_reg_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/pwmv1_reg_reg[12]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/pwmv1_reg_reg[12]_i_1/O, cell design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/pwmv1_reg_reg[12]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/pwmv2_reg_reg[12]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/pwmv2_reg_reg[12]_i_1/O, cell design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/pwmv2_reg_reg[12]_i_1.

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/sccb_req_reg_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/sccb_req_reg_reg_i_1/O, cell design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/sccb_req_reg_reg_i_1.

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/sccb_wdata_reg_reg[31]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/sccb_wdata_reg_reg[31]_i_1/O, cell design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/sccb_wdata_reg_reg[31]_i_1.

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/sccb_wr_reg_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/sccb_wr_reg_reg_i_1/O, cell design_1_inst/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/sccb_wr_reg_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port CAM_SCL expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
